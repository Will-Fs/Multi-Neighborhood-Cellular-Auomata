# Multiple-Neighborhood-Cellular-Auomata
A multiple-neighborhood cellular automata (MNCA) simulation in C# created in Unity

This project uses compute shaders, which allows for much faster processing and computation speeds, as necessary processes for the simulation are carried out simultaneously on the GPU. At the moment, only three "rules" for the simulation are available, but many more will be added soon that increase complexity and yield different results.
